# Espitalia
This is a graduation project. It is a mobile software application that makes the communication between all parties of the healthcare organization easier. Patients wonâ€™t need to waste time at the clinic waiting. They will make reservations online (no need for phone calls). All their medical history is saved and secured online. Doctors can manage their schedule and get all information about their patient clearly through the medical history, avoiding human error. 
Hospitals can also request/provide a donation for blood through the network in the application which will act as an important role in saving the life of human beings in case of emergency. Thus, this application provides the required information in no time and helps in quicker decision making.
